> A non-dividend-paying stock is selling for $160.
  u = 1.5; d = 0.5; r = 18.232% per period
  Hence p = (R − d)/(u − d) = 0.7.
  Consider a European call on this stock with X = 150 and n = 3.
  What is the call/put value? Or what is the PV of the expected payoff at expiration? (by backward induction).
